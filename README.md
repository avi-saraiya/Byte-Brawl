# Byte Brawl - a 2D Combat Game (Python)
This is a 2D fighting game built using Pygame. The game features two playable characters who can move, jump, attack, and engage in a fight.
The player controls are mapped to the keyboard, and the game includes sprite-based animation for actions such as walking, attacking, and taking damage.
The game ends when one player's health reaches zero, and the winner is announced.

* <b>Game Over State:</b> The game ends when a player's health reaches zero.

The Fighter Class defines the core logic for each fighter, including:<br>
* <b>Movement:</b> Players can move left and right using the respective controls.
* <b>Attack:</b> Players can attack by pressing the attack button, which decreases the opponent's health.
* <b>Jump:</b> Fighters can jump when the jump button is pressed.
* <b>Animation:</b> Each action (attack, idle, running, hit) is represented by different frames, which are shown in sequence.
* <b>Health Management:</b> Each player has a health bar that decreases when they are hit by an attack.
### Main Class (main.py)
* <b>Game Setup</b>: The screen, background, and sprite images are initialized.
* <b>Countdown:</b> A countdown is shown at the start before the players can start moving.
* <b>Game Loop:</b> The main loop handles drawing the background, updating the playersâ€™ positions and animations, and checking for collisions (attacks).
* <b>Health Bars:</b> Each player's health is displayed on top of the screen, which decreases when they take damage.
